# Debox

A smart contract is an agreement that needs no external action to execute the terms of the contract. Once the conditions for its execution have been met, the smart contract completes the agreed actions automatically.

Blockchain technology maintains a record of transactions is maintained across several computers linked in a peer-to-peer network. This allows smart contracts to be self-executing, with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller directly written into lines of code existing on a decentralized network.

Ethereum allows developers to write smart contracts which define the EVM\* instructions. (Ethereum Virtual Machine, Decentralized database â€“ allows functional code to be distributed along the decentralized set of nodes.)

Smart contracts render transactions traceable, transparent, and irreversible.

Ethereum Real Estate Contracts are Flexible as contracts may be written so that any number of final sales prices, reductions in price, or increases, can be triggered based on specific events agreed to by the parties.

# Motivation

Blockchain technology has impacted the real estate industry in a variety of ways, including offering a new means for buyers and sellers to connect with one another.

Blockchain could be used to cut intermediaries out of the real estate transaction process, thereby reducing costs.

This technology could also help to codify the practice of fractional ownership of real estate.
