A smart contract is an agreement that needs no external action to execute the terms of the contract. Once the conditions for its execution have been met, the smart contract completes the agreed actions automatically.

Blockchain technology maintains a record of transactions is maintained across several computers linked in a peer-to-peer network. This allows smart contracts to be self-executing, with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller directly written into lines of code existing on a decentralized network.

Ethereum allows developers to write smart contracts which define the EVM\* instructions. (Ethereum Virtual Machine, Decentralized database â€“ allows functional code to be distributed along the decentralized set of nodes.)

Smart contracts render transactions traceable, transparent, and irreversible.

Ethereum Real Estate Contracts are Flexible as contracts may be written so that any number of final sales prices, reductions in price, or increases, can be triggered based on specific events agreed to by the parties.
